# Interactive Water Budget for the Colorado River Basin

This folder contains an interactive water budget tool for the Colorado River Basin that allows Upper Basin, Lower Basin, and Mexico representatives to role play the management of Lake Powell and Lake Mead under different hydrologic scenarios. 
The role play allows participants to explore political water manager decisions for reservoir storage, release, and water conservation decisions plus voluntary, compensated transfers between users.
The role play is particularly helpful for exploring water mmanagement decisions under low flow conditions and what can encourage lots more water conservation that will be needed to balance supplies and demands.
Participants can explore differences between mandatory water conservation (such as the Lower Basin drought contingency plan) and voluntary water conservation (temporary, compensated).
Role players for the Upper Basin, Lower Basin, and Mexico make year-to-year-to-year decisions according to the available water -- account balance plus portion of each year's natural flow.

The role play requires a facilitator and representatives for the Upper Basin, Lower Basin, and Mexico.

The ReadMe-Directions worksheet in each Excel file provides further instructions to complete the role play.

Two versions of the water budget are provided: **InteractiveWaterBudget-PowellMead.xlsx** provides seperate blocks (rows) in the worksheet for reservoir storage, accounts, and release/consumption decisions for Lake Powell and Lake Mead.
The players for the Upper Basin, Lower Basin, and Mexico first make decisions for Lake Powell, then then Lower Basin and Mexico players make decisions for Lake Mead.
**InteractiveWaterBudget-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx** combines Powell and Mead storage into a single lumped reservoir and account. The Upper Basin, Lower Basin, and Mexico players make storage, accounts, and release/consumption decisions
from the lumped reservoir. A political decisions specifies how to phsycially partition the lumped storage among Lake Powell and Lake Mead.

I recommended to move the Excel workbook into Google Docs so that users can play syncronously.
