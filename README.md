# Colorado River Futures - Code Projects

Small and bigger coding efforts in support of work on the Colorado River. Some of the figures generated appear in papers on the Colorado River Futures project website (https://qcnr.usu.edu/coloradoriver/futures)

All coding efforts in R Studio.

Most of these efforts are beginning coding efforts and works in progress.

## Explanation of Contents

1. **EvapCalcs** - plots to show reservoir evaporation for Lakes Mead and Powell as a function of reservoir storage/level. This supports
an alternative management paradigm where reservoir evaporation is counted as part of lower basin users consumptive use.
1. **ICS** - Plots of intentionally created surplus for Lake Mead account balances, puts and takes, and limits.
1. **InteractivePowellBudget** - Work in progress. An water budget for Lake Powell that allows Upper Basin, Lower Basin, and Mexico users to interactively consume/withdraw and trade water for different hydrologic scenarios. A role play exercise.
1. **InterimShortageGuidelines** - plots of cutbacks in deliveries as a function of Lake Mead level. Both for the Interim Guidelines and newly released Drought Contingency Plan.
1. **LakePowellTemperatureScenarios** - Calcualtes the Lake Powell release temperatures for different lake levels. Assigns release temperatures to different fish scenarios.
1. **MeadPowellPlots** - visualization of the Lake Powell-Lake Mead Equalization rules. This is Powell annual release as a function of Powell storage and Mead storage. Also includes plots that show the reservoir zones.
1. **Powell10Year** - Plots showing Lake Powell 10-year releases in comparison to Colorado River Compact Article III(d) requirement
1. **Runge_MCDM_Analysis** - interactive parallel coordinate plot visualization of the 18 objectives use in the analysis by Runge et al of Glend Canyon Dam management alternatives. Runge, M. C., LaGory, K. E., Russell, K., Balsom, J. R., Butler, R. A., Coggins, J. L. G., Grantz, K. A., Hayse, J., Hlohowskyj, I., Korman, J., May, J. E., O'Rourke, D. J., Poch, L. A., Prairie, J. R., VanKuiken, J. C., Van Lonkhuyzen, R. A., Varyu, D. R., Verhaaren, B. T., Veselka, T. D., Williams, N. T., Wuthrich, K. K., Yackulic, C. B., Billerbeck, R. P., and Knowles, G. W. (2015).

1. **TimeToDeadPool** - a steady deterministic analysis of the number of years to hit Lake Mead (or Lake Powell) dead pool (or other target elevation) given a starting storage volume, steady inflow, and steady demand. Used to explore alternative management policies where reservoir release is a function of reservoir storage and inflow.

To run any code, download and install R and RStudio. Within the subfolder, open the .R file, highlight all the code, and run. Some subfolders also have an R Markdown file (.rmd) that can be run to generate a single PDF file of all results.
