# Encouraging more Water Conservation in the Colorado River Basin

This folder contains an interactive water budget tool for the Colorado River Basin that allows Upper Basin, Lower Basin, and Mexico representatives to role play the management of Lake Powell and Lake Mead under different hydrologic scenarios. 
The role play allows participants to explore reservoir storage, release, and water conservation decisions.
The role play is particularly helpful for exploring water mmanagement decisions under low flow conditions when lots more
water conservation will be needed to balance supplies and demands.
Participants can explore mandatory water conservation (such as the Lower Basin drought contingency plan) and voluntary water conservation (temporary, compensated).

This interactive role play requires a facillitator and representatives of the Upper Basin, Lower Basin, and Mexico. 
The players manage Lake Powell and Lake Mead year by year. A facilitator decides the hydrology to use and reveals natural inflow to Lake Powell year-by-year to the players.
Each player decides the volume to consumptively use/release/store each year in Lake Powell.
Additionally, the Upper Basin can voluntarily transfer water from its Lake Powell account to the Lower Basin's Lake Powell account with compensation.
Mexico can also voluntarily transfer stored water to the Lower Basin with compensation.
The interactive water budget tracks physical water budget items such as Powell evaporation rate, Powell starting storage, natural inflow to Lake Powell, and Evaporated volume.
The interactive water budget also tracks one time political (water manager) decisions such as Division of existing Powell storage and Division of annual available water among users.
The interactive water budget also allows and tracks Annual political (water manager) decisions  such as the Mexico treaty bligation, Withdrawals/Consumptive Use from Lake Powell accounts, 

The interactive water budget similarly allows and tracks a similar set of decisions and conditions for Lake Mead.

I recommended to move the Excel workbook into Google Docs so that users can play syncronously.
