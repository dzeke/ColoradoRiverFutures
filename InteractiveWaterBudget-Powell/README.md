# Interactive Water Budget and Role Play for Lake Powell, Colorado River

This folder contains an interactive water budget tool for Lake Powell that allows users to role play the management of Lake Powell under different hydrologic scenarios. 

This interactive role play requires a facillitator and representatives of the Upper Basin, Lower Basin, and Mexico. 
The players can manage for 10 years in the future. A facilitator decides the hydrology to use and reveals natural inflow to Lake Powell year-by-year to the players.
Each player decides the volume to consumptively use/release/store each year. Additionally, the Upper Basin can voluntarily transfer stored water to the Lower Basin with compensation.
The spreadsheet model tracks physical water budget items such as Powell evaporation rate, Powell starting storage, natural inflow to Lake Powell, and Evaporated volume.
The spreadsheet model also tracks one time political (water manager) decisions such as Division of existing Powell storage and Division of Annual available water among users.
The model also tracks Annual political (water manager) decisions  such as the Mexico treaty bligation, Withdrawals/Consumptive Use from Lake Powell accounts, and Upper Basin Transfer to Lower Basin account with payment.											

It is recommended to move the Excel workbook into Google Docs so that users can play syncronously.
